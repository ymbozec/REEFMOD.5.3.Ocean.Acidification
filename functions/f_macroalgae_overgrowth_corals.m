% Implements the overgrowth of corals by any macroalgae
% a = 3 -> Lobophora
% a = 2 -> Dictyota
% local_Malg_pct is the current cover of macroalgae over the 5 cells
% the function operates for all the colonies of every species within a cell (vectorization)

% // in the refrence code this is implemented as a series of code blocks one for each coral type
% // here each coral is processed by the same code, since the only difference appears to be in
% // the value returned by CORAL.lobophora_reduce_rate which formerly was ALGAL_CORAL_BRD_RESIST,
% // ALGAL_CORAL_SPW_RESIST, ALGAL_CORAL_BRD_VUL, ALGAL_CORAL_SPW_VUL and effectively zero for Acropora
% // since this did not have a code block. Now instead of having explicit code for each coral type just
% // set the value of CORAL.lobophora_reduce_rate for each coral type (zero for no effect, eg, acropora)
