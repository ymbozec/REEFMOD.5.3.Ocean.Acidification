============== File description ===============================

1) track_colony

A list of all coral colonies populated by the model at every time step.
There is one row per colony per time step. Each column corresponds to:

1- Time step (0 for initial step)
2- 'Vertical' coordinate of the coral colony on the grid (y-coordinate of the corresponding cell)
3- 'Horizontal' coordinate of the coral colony on the grid (x-coordinate of the corresponding cell)
4- Size of the coral colony in cm2 (maximum size is the size of a cell)
5- Colony ID of the coral
6- Species ID of the coral

Notes:
# Combining 5 & 6 gives a unique identifier to each coral.
# Dead colonies disappear from the list at the time they die


2) track_environ

A list of all other benthic covers populated by the model at every time step.
There is one row per benthic class per time step. Each column corresponds to:

1- Time step (0 for initial step)
2- 'Vertical' coordinate of the benthic class on the grid (y-coordinate of the corresponding cell)
3- 'Horizontal' coordinate of the benthic class on the grid (x-coordinate of the corresponding cell)
4- Size of the benthic class in cm2
5- ID of the benthic class: 0-Sand (ungrazable substratum)1-Turf2-Dictyota3-Lobophora4-Halimeda

Notes:
# Sand takes a full cell
# Sandy cells cannot be colonized by any other type (nor grazed)
# Sandy cells are determined randomly at the start of the simulation and remain inchanged over time
# The dynamics of Halimeda are not implemented yet (0 cm2 at any time in any cell)
# The sum of Lobophora and Dictyota in a given cell may eventually exceed cell size (10000cm2) as Dict can overtop Lob


3) track_disturb

The chronology of external disturbances
There is one row per time step (one time step = 6 months). Each column corresponds to:

1- Time step (0 for initial step)
2- Corresponding season (1-winter0-summer)
3- The occurence of a bleaching event (0-no1-yes)
4- The category of hurricane (0-no hurricanethen 1-5)

Notes:
# The initial step (t=0) is winter, the first time step (t=1) is summer and so on.
# Bleaching and hurricanes cannot occur in winter
# Bleaching cannot occur when a hurricane occurs
