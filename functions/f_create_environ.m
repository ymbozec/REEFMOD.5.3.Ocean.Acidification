function [environ] = f_create_environ (m,n)

% Determine the surrounding cells of a given cell for calculating
% its environment (coral and algal covers).
% Currently implemented for identifying the 4 surrounding cells
% but can be easily extended to 8, ...
% Note: x gives row indices, y column indices
% For a given cell i, the surrounding cells are defined as follow:
%  			  y
%  		 _ _ _ _ _ _
%  		|_|_|_|_|_|_| 
%  		|_|_|t|_|_|_|  
%  	x	|_|l|i|r|_|_| 
%  		|_|_|b|_|_|_| 
%  		|_|_|_|_|_|_|


%  			  y
%  		 _ _ _ _ _ _
%  		|_|_|_|_|_|_| 
%  		|_|2|3|4|_|_|  
%  	x	|_|9|1|5|_|_| 
%  		|_|8|7|6|_|_| 
%  		|_|_|_|_|_|_|
